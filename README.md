# ChessGame
Chess application made using Python
Requires Python 3.12.6 and pygame to be installed

Application currently opens to a menu where you can choose to play against another player locally or against an AI
**Play against an AI is not implemented yet but is being planned**
     -- a skeleton of the ai has been created but implementation has stopped there for now
     -- minmax algorithm will be used where the ai is the minimizer
Local play is mostly set up, but there are still some bugs that are showing up to work out:
     -- there is a glitch where if a king moves after castling it can duplicate itself and be in the previous and new positions
     -- other glitches could show up that im not currently aware of
