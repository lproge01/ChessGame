# ChessGame
Chess application made using Python
Requires Python 3.12.6 and pygame to be installed

Application currently opens to a menu where you can choose to play against another player locally or against an AI
**Play against an AI is not implemented yet but is being planned**
Local play is possible but there are still some kinks to work out:
     - currently does not end the game properly
     - when the game does end it needs a menu to play again or go back to the main menu
     - castling logic needs to be finished
     - promotion logic and display needs to be started on
     - en passant logic needs to be implemented
